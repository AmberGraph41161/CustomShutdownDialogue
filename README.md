# CustomShutdownDialogue
This was just a project that I worked on for the fun of it, as well as the learning part of it.
I'm not a professional coder.
The project is really messy code, but I think that I can learn from that.
Read license please if you're gonna do something with the project

Also, if you see any typos with "dialogue" spelled as "dialog," sorry. Didn't know the real spelling at first
and had to change alot of file names, and might have missed some.
